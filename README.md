# MiscNinja Paper

Paper is the front-facing UI component of the MiscNinja project. It is intended to be a semantic layer over the internet; i.e. it uses AI to smoothen a user's interaction with the internet - both the searching and browsing experiences.

## Run via Docker

Detailed instructions on building coming soon.

docker pull lordspline/miscninja-paper
